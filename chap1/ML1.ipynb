    "model parameter values that minimize a cost function).\n",
    "</p><p>\n",
    "• Finally, you applied the model to make predictions on new cases (this is called\n",

    "<p>\n",
    "The model is overffiting the data, it is too complex relative to the amount and noisiness of the training data. For regularization, possible solutions are:\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "• Simplify the model by selecting one with fewer parameters (e.g., a linear model rather than a high-degree polynomial model), by reducing the number of attributes in the training data, or by constraining the model.\n",

    "<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n",

    "<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n",

    "<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n",
    "The train-dev set is used when there is a risk of mismatch between the training data and the data used in the  validation and test datasets (which should always be as close as possible to the data used once the model is in production). The train-dev set is a part of the training set that’s held out (the model is not trained on it). The model is trained on the rest of the training set, and evaluated on both the train-dev set and the validation set. If the model performs well on the training set but not on the train-dev set, then the model is likely overfitting the training set. If it performs well on both the training set and the train-dev set, but not on the validation set, then there is probably a significant data mismatch between the training data and the validation + best data, and you should try to improve the training data to make it look more like the validation + test data.\n",
